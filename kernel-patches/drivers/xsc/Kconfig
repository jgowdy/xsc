	  This option enables support for the eXtended Syscall (XSC) interface,
	  which provides a ring-based syscall mechanism for improved performance.

	  The XSC interface allows userspace applications to submit system call
	  requests through submission/completion rings instead of traditional
	  syscall instructions, reducing context switching overhead.

	  If you plan to run XSC-enabled applications, say Y or M here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here. The module
	  will be called xsc_core.

	  If unsure, say N.
