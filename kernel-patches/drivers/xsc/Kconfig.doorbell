config XSC_DOORBELL
	bool "XSC ARM64 Doorbell Runtime Validation"
	depends on ARM64
	default y
	help
	  Enables runtime validation and monitoring of ARM64 doorbell
	  mechanisms for XSC. Never trusts hardware doorbells without
	  comprehensive validation.

	  This implements a progressive trust model:
	    candidate -> preflight -> validate -> steady_state (or rollback)

	  Validation includes:
	    - MMIO sanity checks
	    - IRQ delivery verification
	    - Memory ordering validation
	    - Latency threshold checks
	    - Power state transition tests
	    - Coalescing detection
	    - Runtime watchdog monitoring

	  If validation fails, the system automatically falls back to
	  adaptive polling with no loss of functionality.

	  Exposes statistics and control via:
	    /sys/kernel/xsc/doorbell/

	  Say Y if you want XSC to use hardware doorbells on ARM64
	  platforms. Say N to always use polling.

	  If unsure, say Y.
