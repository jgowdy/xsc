echo "=== Analysis of Build Approach ==="
echo
echo "PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "  - Previous approach tried to run XSC binaries on standard Linux"
echo "  - XSC binaries use ring-based syscalls, can't execute on normal kernels"
echo "  - dpkg-buildpackage runs test programs during build â†’ immediate failure"
echo
echo "CORRECT APPROACH:"
echo "  Option 1: Build inside running XSC kernel (complex bootstrap)"
echo "  Option 2: Proper cross-compilation with Canadian Cross"
echo "  Option 3: Source-only builds without execution"
echo
echo "RECOMMENDATION:"
echo "  For Debian packages, we need Option 1 - native build environment"
echo "  This requires:"
echo "    1. Minimal XSC userspace (busybox, bash, coreutils)"
echo "    2. Boot XSC kernel with this minimal rootfs"
echo "    3. Install Debian build tools compiled for XSC"
echo "    4. Build all packages natively"
echo
echo "This will take several phases:"
echo "  Phase 1: Build minimal XSC userspace from source"
echo "  Phase 2: Create bootable XSC environment"
echo "  Phase 3: Bootstrap Debian build system inside XSC"
echo "  Phase 4: Build all 1,809 packages natively"
echo
echo "Estimated time: 7-10 days on 80 cores"

echo
echo "Starting Phase 1: Building minimal XSC userspace..."
echo "(This requires building busybox, bash, coreutils from source)"
echo
echo "NOT IMPLEMENTED YET - This is a significant undertaking."
echo "Would you like to:"
echo "  1. Implement full bootstrap"
echo "  2. Try hybrid approach (QEMU user-mode emulation)"
echo "  3. Re-evaluate project scope"
