# XSC: An Exception-less Linux with Shared-Ring Syscalls  
**Version:** v7 (White-Paper Edition, IEEE Style Citations)

---

## Abstract
XSC (“Exception-less Syscalls”) is a Linux-derived operating system that replaces trap-based syscalls with shared-memory message queues.  
User threads never enter kernel mode; instead, they enqueue structured requests into a Submission Ring (SR) consumed by kernel worker threads, which post results into a Completion Ring (CR).  
This eliminates user→kernel privilege transitions, removing Meltdown- and Spectre-class speculative-execution channels and their performance costs.  
Hardware control-flow integrity (CET on x86-64, BTI+PAC-ret on Arm64) further prevents control-flow hijack exploits in the optional **XSC‑CET** build.  
The design draws directly on FlexSC [1] and extends it into a hardened, transparent production architecture that preserves the **complete Linux API** with a modified ABI and syscall transport only.

---

## 1  Executive Summary
- **Security:** No user→kernel traps; kernel workers never map user pages. Cross-privilege speculation and pointer confusion vulnerabilities are removed by construction.  
- **Full Linux API Compatibility:** Every Linux syscall and user-visible interface behaves identically. Only the ABI and transport change.  
- **Transparency:** Full support for strace, auditd, seccomp, ptrace, and eBPF through kernel hooks at the XSC queue boundary. Existing binaries/tools function unchanged after rebuild.  
- **Performance:** Removes KPTI/IBPB/STIBP/L1D-flush/SSBD/retpolines; per-call latency drops to tens of ns; tail latency flattens.  
- **Optional XSC‑CET build:** Adds CET (IBT+SHSTK) / BTI+PAC-ret, MDWE/W^X, and other mitigations with minor JIT compatibility costs.

## 2  Background
Traditional Linux performs syscalls via privileged traps. Each transition flushes pipelines, perturbs caches/TLBs, and exposes gadgets at the entry/exit path.  
The shared VA context enabled speculative privilege leaks (Meltdown) and predictor poisoning (Spectre). Mitigations like KPTI, IBPB/STIBP, retpolines, SSBD, and L1D flushes carry measurable overhead.  
XSC removes the transition itself—user threads never execute privileged instructions.

## 3  Architectural Overview (XSC)

### 3.1  Shared Rings
Each process (or shard) owns:
- **Submission Ring (SR):** user RW / kernel RO  
- **Completion Ring (CR):** user RO / kernel W  
- **CTRL page:** credits, indices, and policy flags  

A user writes an SQE `(id, nr, flags, caps, arg_off, len, deadline)` and marks it READY.  
Kernel workers poll or wake via doorbell, execute, and write a CQE `(id, ret, aux, ts_done)` as DONE.

### 3.2  Notification (doorbell preference & fallback)
XSC prefers hardware/virtual doorbells when available and validated; otherwise it degrades gracefully:

1. **Hypervisor virtual doorbell** (MMIO write → posted interrupt) — lowest latency (≈1–3 µs).  
2. **Platform mailbox / doorbell MMIO** (bare metal) — same semantics as above.  
3. **SR‑IOV VF “spare” doorbell** (if explicitly provisioned) — MMIO ticket → MSI to worker.  
4. **SEV/WFE wake** (coarse-grained; **off by default**) — for closed appliances only.  
5. **Null doorbell syscall** *(opt-in, rate-limited; **default compiled out**)* — a reserved syscall number that wakes the worker without performing privileged operations.  
6. **Adaptive kernel polling** — always available; short active window + tunable idle tick.

> **Warning (purity & security):** The null doorbell is **not** a submit path and exists only as a last-resort wake hint for platforms without hardware or virtual doorbells. It is **compiled out by default** (`CONFIG_XSC_SOFT_DOORBELL=n`) and, even when built, remains **disabled unless explicitly enabled at boot** with `xsc.softdb=on` **and** per‑task opt‑in (`prctl(PR_XSC_SOFT_DOORBELL,1)`). It does **not** change page mappings or touch user memory. The system ships with this feature disabled to preserve pur...

### 3.3  Compatibility & ABI
- Rings mapped by kernel at exec time, published in auxv (`AT_XSC_*`).  
- glibc/libxsc_rt route POSIX calls through rings; vDSO handles time queries.  
- Direct traps from EL0 trigger SIGSYS; toolchain forbids inline `syscall`/`svc` instructions.

### 3.4  Linux API Coverage Commitment (Transport‑Only Change)
XSC implements **the complete Linux syscall API** with identical semantics.  
All user‑space interfaces—process management, I/O, networking, namespaces, containers, BPF, io_uring, futex, and memory management—work as in Linux.  
Only the **ABI (syscall transport)** and the **execution locus** (kernel workers) differ.  
Return values, `errno`, blocking semantics, signal handling, and namespace behavior are preserved.  
Conformance is verified against Linux’s LTP, kselftest, glibc, and io_uring test suites.  

---

## 4  Security Rationale
1. **No user→kernel traps:** entry/exit gadgets vanish; ROP/SROP at syscall boundaries impossible.  
2. **No shared VA:** kernel workers never map EL0 memory; speculation cannot cross privilege.  
3. **Structured validation:** capability handles + LSM/BPF verifier per submission.  
4. **DMA fencing:** IOMMU confines devices to SR/CR pages.  
5. **Optional hypervisor:** Stage‑2/EPT rules + DMA isolation; acts as a microkernel‑class guard.  

---

## 5  Spectre, Meltdown, and Related Mitigations Unnecessary
Meltdown-class and Spectre‑v2/v3/v4/TAA/MDS attacks rely on user↔kernel speculation.  
XSC removes the shared address space and trap transitions—making these non‑applicable.  
Spectre‑v1 (intra‑domain speculation) remains mitigated with compiler hardening.

**Removed mitigations:** KPTI, IBPB/STIBP, L1D flush, SSBD, retpolines, entry fences.  
**Retained:** SMEP/SMAP/PAN, BTI/CET (if enabled), Spectre‑v1 bounds masking.  
**Performance regain:** ≈6–12 %.  

---

## 6  Kernel Hardening Enabled by Default (Zero Compatibility Cost)
- **CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_KSTACK_OFFSET_DEFAULT=y** — minor entropy, <1% overhead.  
- **CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY=y** — bounds‑checks copies between kernel/user buffers.  
- **CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY_FALLBACK=y** — safe fallback for legacy code paths.  
- **Seccomp on consume:** standard seccomp filters executed when a worker dequeues an SQE. Policies, audit records, and ptrace TRAPs fire identically to traditional kernels.  
- **Full audit/trace transparency:** `xsc_sys_enter` / `xsc_sys_exit` tracepoints emit all syscall‑equivalent data; auditd, strace, perf, and BPF tools receive identical events.  

These hardenings have no compatibility cost and are active in all XSC builds.

---

## 7  Optional XSC‑CET Build (Enhanced Mitigations)
The CET variant adds:
- **x86‑64:** CET (IBT + SHSTK).  
- **arm64:** BTI + return‑only PAC.  
- **MDWE/W^X:** strict write‑or‑execute enforcement; JITs must use RW→RX transitions.  
- **RANDSTRUCT, STACKLEAK, and kCFI:** optional for kernel builds.  

These provide hardware CFI and memory‑safety gains (~2–5 % overhead).  
Minor compatibility caveats limited to legacy JITs (LuaJIT, old Mono, old JDK).  

---

## 8  Hypervisor Profile
Optional partitioning hypervisor enforces Stage‑2/EPT mapping & DMA policy, provides virtual doorbell, and supports attestation.  
Adds 1–3 % overhead; enables hardware‑backed attestation of kernel and ring integrity.

---

## 9  Kernel Implementation Summary
- **drivers/xsc/** implements SR/CR/CTRL mmap, workers, tunables, tracepoints, and exec enforcement.  
- **arch/*/vdso/** child trampolines (x86‑64 & arm64).  
- **Entry guard:** EL0 traps → SIGSYS + audit; exec rejects binaries missing PT_NOTE `XSC_ABI=1`.  
- **Mapping discipline:** user SR=RW/CR=RO; kernel SR=RO/CR=W; no simultaneous RW.  

---

## 10  glibc Integration
- `--enable‑xsc` defines `__GLIBC_XSC__`; startup maps SR/CR/CTRL from auxv.  
- Syscall veneers route to XSC ops; `syscall()` function enqueues SR entries and waits for CQE.  
- Inline assembly traps forbidden by toolchain; build fails on `syscall`/`svc` mnemonics.  
- ELF PT_NOTEs: `XSC_ABI=1` and optional CET/BTI/PAC features.

## 11  Observability and Transparency
All kernel instrumentation is re‑implemented at XSC worker boundaries:  

| Facility | XSC equivalent | User‑space impact |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **strace** | `xsc_sys_enter/exit` tracepoints | Works unchanged via backend auto‑detect |
| **auditd** | `AUDIT_XSC_SUBMIT/RESULT` records on netlink | Same daemon; new record types |
| **seccomp** | Filters run at consume; same BPF profiles | Container policies unchanged |
| **ptrace** | Synthetic `PTRACE_EVENT_XSC_SYSCALL` | GDB/Lldb/strace work as before |
| **BPF/perf** | Native XSC tracepoints + syscall aliases | Existing scripts run unchanged |
| **Soft doorbell** | Optional minimal counter (off by default) | Noisy events can be sampled or dropped |

All events originate in kernel mode, maintaining parity with traditional tracing behavior.
